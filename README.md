Individual project for Masters of Code 2015 - San Francisco.

Project URL: http://www.hackathon.io/donationhub

IDEA: Create an online marketplace where donors sign up and make either one-time donations or donation subscriptions to different types of charities/causes. Charities and causes sign up and create their accounts. The main difference from other sites is that here there is a machine learning alrgorithm that decides how to split the donations based on what charities/causes need the money the most.

This project uses:
- PHP
- HTML / CSS / Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Master Card Simplify Commer API's
